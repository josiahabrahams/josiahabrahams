  # Josiah Abrahams
  I am an 18-year-old entry-level software developer looking for a position that will allow me to learn on the job and refine my skills. I recently graduated from the CodeSpace Academy, where I completed a software development course. I am proficient in CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and the React framework (using Vite to support the framework). I am a dedicated and hardworking student who is always up for a challenge. My studies have prepared me to learn independently and have instilled a commitment to continuously learning new languages, which will help me become a better software developer and a reliable employee.
