  # Josiah Abrahams
  I am an 18 year old entry level software developer looking for a position that will allow me to learn on the job and refine my skills. I am a recent graduate from the CodeSpace academy,
  where I completed a software development course, and I am proficient in Css, Html,  Javascript,  and the React framework  ( using Vite to support it ).
  My studies have prepared me to be able to learn independently and a commitment  to keep learning new languages which will help me become a better software developer and a reliable employee.
  . I am dedicated and hardworking student that is always up for the challenge
